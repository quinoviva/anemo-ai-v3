/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Anemo Check.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, where `userId` must match the authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent enumeration attacks.
 * - The default security posture is to deny access unless explicitly allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `User` document's `id` field MUST match the `userId` in the path `/users/{userId}`. This ensures that only the authenticated user can create their own document.
 * - The `User` document's `id` field is immutable after creation.
